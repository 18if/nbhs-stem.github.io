<h2>What To Expect</h2> 
<p>STEM is a very rigerous program that offers students an opportunity to take advanced classes that not everyone in their 
grade level are exposed to. These classes are fast pace which will allow the student to get a feel for what to expect later
on in their career or what they think of doing in the future.</p> 
<p> The classes you would be expected to take as a freshman STEM academy student are biology honors, algebra 2 honors geometry 
honors and introduction to engineering. Students will have a 1-10 schedule meaning that their first period class will commence at 
7:40 and will leave the school at 3:07. The students will move as a unit through their highschool career. </p>
