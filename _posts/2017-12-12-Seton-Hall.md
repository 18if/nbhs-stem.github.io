Seton Hall (I hope I'm spelling it right). It was...umm... interesting.


The meeting was 30 more minutes than I thought it would be. I saced out a bit to be honest. What the nice lady saidn didn't really apply to me, so I didn't give it much attention since the college didn't focus on the things I'm interested in.


At the end, I was rushed and made a couple of mistakes. For example I think my addres was wrong..., also I didn't check any boxes in. But all in all it wsa all right.
