Seton hall was a great experience in which I did learn some opportunites for scholarships and such. Seton hall has many interhsips in which I would apply. It has the major in which I want to be in; which is Biomedical Engineering. This meeting was suppose to be only 10 minutes but for some reason it took the whole period.


It also had other majors that seem interesting. The only good reason to join seton hall is for the major they have and the scholarships they are able to give you.
