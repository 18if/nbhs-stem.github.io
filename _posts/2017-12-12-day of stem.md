Um, I think STEM is pretty decent. I like it personally, I don't want to leave it either. Im trying to kickbutt this marking period and not hiccup like the last. 
I don't like High School though, because it's time is unreasonable and should obly be for two years. School is boring and I want to get it over with. My sleeping schedule is all jacked up as always.
