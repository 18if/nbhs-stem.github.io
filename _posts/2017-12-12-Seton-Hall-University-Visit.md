Today, a representative from Seton Hall University visited the school. The representatve seemed to be very friendly, too. She spoke briefly about the 90+ majors and minors. They also offered about 20 scholarships with many varieties. Scholarships would be offered to those with great community service hours, or even people with great grades as well as athletic ability. She added that for acceptance into the university, GPAs and ACT scores are the top priority. However, they would focus more on the ACT score because they believe that it shows more about the student than the GPA, which may be weighed heavier depending on the courses.
