Seton hall was a great experience in which I did learn some opportunites for scholarships and such. Seton hall has many interhsips in which I would apply. It has the major in which I want to be in; which is Biomedical Engineering. This meeting was suppose to be only 10 minutes but for some reason it took the whole period.
