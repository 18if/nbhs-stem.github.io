I am currently a freshman in high school and a STEM student. I am really enjoying all my classes. Of course, there are times where I am very upset that I get less hours of sleep now. However, I really love all my classmates and teachers. My favorite classes would have to be Algebra 2 and Biology. Often there are times in which I feel lost in class. However, my teachers quickly come to aid me and try and help me better understand what is going on. I spend half of my day with the same people and that kind of sucks since I don't get to see more people. However, I am glad I made a good bond with my classmates.
