Um, I think STEM is pretty decent. I like it personally, I don't want to leave it either. Im trying to kickbutt this marking period and not hiccup like the last. 
I don't like High School though, because it's time is unreasonable and should only be for two years. School is boring and I want to get it over with. My sleeping schedule is all jacked up as always. 

Oh, and Zoey is getting bigger which is making me sad because ya know, shes my baby afterall. She eats a lot.  <3

This is an extension, I woke up really hungry and I Was listening to the Beatles while I fell asleep!
